**Reproducibility Challenge**

In this folder there are three sets of instructions, one for each module. At the top of each markdown file there are links to the modules stored in google drive. As you go through the file, there are links that point to papers, files, and external websites. Each file can be downloaded safely and run in google colab for .py files or Rstudio for .r files.
