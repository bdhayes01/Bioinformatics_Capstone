## Section 1: Two Genetics Populations in Britain
This section pulled numbers from the first three paragraphs of
[Quantifying the contribution of recessive coding variation to developmental disorders](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar6731?casa_token=B8mi7XvWvqAAAAAA%3Ant_1zKNG7bshPNBVbJDT4em3h5hosfAipGxKyEP6Y5rTsVCYJfYSg19ySijqHfmlQ8-oO9cN0nqX4Q) by Martin et. al.
It also has an excerpt from a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/creativediversity/nuance-in-bame/pakistani)
and statistics from another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5079102/) to support the claim those of Pakistani descent in Britain showed higher consanguinity.

## Section 2: Analyzing Genotypes of Disease
The graph used from the second section using the two populations in Britain was pulled from [this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar6731?casa_token=B8mi7XvWvqAAAAAA%3Ant_1zKNG7bshPNBVbJDT4em3h5hosfAipGxKyEP6Y5rTsVCYJfYSg19ySijqHfmlQ8-oO9cN0nqX4Q). The actual graph used (figure 1 in the paper) was very complicated and referenced genetics beyond what was necessary for introductory biology students to use. We created a simplified graph for students to reference, using google drawings to remake figure 1 into a format more accessible for students.

## Section 3: Assessing Modes of Inheritance 
This section displays pedigrees that were made from data in [Table S6](https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/science.aar6731/suppl_file/aar6731_martin_table-s6.xlsx) in
supplementary Material of the [Martin paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar6731?casa_token=B8mi7XvWvqAAAAAA%3Ant_1zKNG7bshPNBVbJDT4em3h5hosfAipGxKyEP6Y5rTsVCYJfYSg19ySijqHfmlQ8-oO9cN0nqX4Q).
1. The pedigree in question 1 displays data from the column with Decipher ID 264607. We can see that the inheritance is biallelic, so the pedigree displays that mode of inheritance.
2. The pedigree in question 2 is an example of what inherited monoallelic would look like. There is no data this is based on, but we can see the mode of inheritance in figure 4A of the paper.
3. The pedigree in question 3 based on the column with Decipher ID 268052. The inheritance is de novo, so we know that the pedigree would look as shown in the module.

## Section 4: Examining Alternative Modes of Inheritance
The graph seen in the fourth section of the module was used directly from figure 2 of [this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar6731?casa_token=B8mi7XvWvqAAAAAA%3Ant_1zKNG7bshPNBVbJDT4em3h5hosfAipGxKyEP6Y5rTsVCYJfYSg19ySijqHfmlQ8-oO9cN0nqX4Q).

## Section 5: Founder's Effect and Homozygosity
The table used in the final section of this module was made from the data found in [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05473-8?fromPaywallRec=true) paper under the section titled “GWAs of Nationwide Health Registries”. The full data set provided much more information than was necessary for the understanding of Biology 100 students. We created our own table using the same data but removing extraneous data for the subject we were examining.
