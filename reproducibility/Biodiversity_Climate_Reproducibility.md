**Guiana Highlands** <br>  
The data for the Guiana Highlands [module-student version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VFy84Z8rXZ7zAa_e-FKLHhU90whAqbTTdkwSo4vUSJE/edit?usp=sharing), including the table and map, comes from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712001796) from Vilarrubia et. al. Here is the Guiana Highlands [module-instructor version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QjTuozbLjQ0tHPqVfUqr_smitfRuIb9XOsIHZas_E4/edit?usp=sharing).

The map is created on this [website](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=18d32a699af64bfba4e78eba5a4dd705). First zoom in on the region slightly north of the Amazon rainforest, similar to this [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiana_Shield#/media/File:Map_of_the_Guiana_shield.png) which is close to Venezuela in South America. Then set the Properties (in the top-right corner) > Layers > World Topographic Map > Appearance > Transparency to 100%, then setting World Topographic Map (with contours and hillshade) > Appearance > Transparency to 100%, as shown in the [screenshot](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/reproducibility/guiana_map_maker.png) below. The map is based on Figure B from the paper referenced above, locates different experimental sites, and is colored according to the instructions below the table in our module. 

The table is also taken from the paper, adjusting the abbreviations for clarity. 

The Species Loss to Elevation graph is created using [this .R file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/graphs/species_loss_to_elevation.R). The Area Loss to Species Loss graph is created with [another .R file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/graphs/area_loss_to_species_loss.R).

**Global Biodiversity Loss** <br>  
The table that this section references is on page 68 of a [Millenium Assessment pdf](https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf). 

The interactive website is created using [this .html file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/index.html), with an accompanying [instructions](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/Instructions.html) file. The screenshots come from the interactive website.
