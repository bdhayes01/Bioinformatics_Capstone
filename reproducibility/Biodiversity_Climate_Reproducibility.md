**Guiana Highlands** <br>  
The data for the Guiana Highlands section, including the table and map, comes from [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320712001796) from Vilarrubia et. al. 

The map is created on this [website](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?layers=18d32a699af64bfba4e78eba5a4dd705), setting the Properties > Layers > World Topographic Map > Transparency to 100%. The map is based on Figure B from the paper referenced above. This map locates different experimental sites. The map is colored according to the instructions below the table. 

The table is also taken from the paper, adjusted for clarity. 

The Species Loss to Elevation graph is created using [this .R file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/graphs/species_loss_to_elevation.R). The Area Loss to Species Loss graph is created with [another .R file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/graphs/area_loss_to_species_loss.R).

**Global Biodiversity Loss** <br>  
The table that this section references is on page 68 of a [Millenium Assessment pdf](https://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf). 

The interactive website is created using [this .html file](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/main/index.html). The screenshots come from the interactive website.
