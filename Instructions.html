<p>
    Read through the articles. Carefully study the tables. <br>
    Which climate is most similar to the two unfinished climates? <br>
    Think about what the driver effects may be on the climate, <br>
    and discuss this with your lab mates.
</p>
<h3>
    Step 2:
</h3>
<p>
    Make your guesses as to what the climates look like!<br>
    Double-click on the rectangle to edit it. <br>
    After double-clicking, the rectangle will be highlighted in green. <br>
