**Yellowstone Wolves:** <br>  
The Yellowstone wolves data was pulled from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanbrouwer/yellowstone-wolves), available on kaggle. After giving a brief background, a graph was given for students to interact with. The code for producing the graph is on the [github](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/Graph-Creation/Population_Growth_Yellowstone_Wolves_Graph) we made for the project. As per the comments, the code will produce the answer key, while commenting out two line creation functions (lines 22 & 27) will produce the graph for students. 

**Daphnia:** <br>  
The [Daphnia_Population.txt](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/Data/Daphnia_Population.txt) file comes from a zip file given by Dr. Blaine Griffin. This file is used in two papers, [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09389) and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19141422/). This data was transformed by the [daphnia_graph.R](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/Graph-Creation/daphnia_graph.R) file to create two graphs, one that is empty and one that has the answer data points. 

The table in the module was created by copying the population [numbers](https://github.com/bdhayes01/Bioinformatics_Capstone/blob/Data/Daphnia_Population.txt) into a table in Google Docs, the ‘week’ column coming from measurements referenced in the paper. There is a best fit line drawn on the module's answer key that was created using the Drawing feature of Docs, using Insert > Drawing > New > (Copy and paste the Daphnia graph) > Select Line > Scribble > (Draw a best-fit line).

**World Population:** <br>  
After a background on world population growth, a graph of Japan is displayed. This graph is a screenshot from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1066956/population-japan-historical/), and other examples of logistic growth in national populations are linked below the Japanese Graph. 

A few questions are asked below the population graph, and then supplementary information cites where the data was gathered.
